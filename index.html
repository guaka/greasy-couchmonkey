I like the greasymonkey scripts I found for couchsurfing and decided to write one of my own.  Greasy Couchmonkey mostly removes stuff from the CS website, e.g. "getting verified" annoyances.  I was also inspired to start a killfile for groups.  To use the killfile you still have to manually edit a javascript array right now, but I might go ahead and make an effort at adding a user interface for it.

Of course it's free software, I've placed it on <a href="http://github.com/guaka/greasy-couchmonkey/">github</a> and patches are of course very welcome.

<p>
To try it you have to <a href="http://getfirefox.com/">use Firefox</a> and install <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/748">Greasemonkey</a>.
